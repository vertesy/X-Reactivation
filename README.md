#### Vértesy, Á. et al., 2018. Parental haplotype-specific single-cell transcriptomics reveal incomplete epigenetic reprogramming in human female germ cells. Nature Communications, 9(1), p.1873. Available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29760424.





The aim of this repository is to provide an insight, and be a transparent about the analyses, as well as to help readers build similar pipelines.

Therefore, the scripts are provided as a resource, not as an executable pipeline. The authors apologize to the reader, but cannot provide support on troubleshooting if the reader tries to run (parts of) the pipeline on his or her own machine.

We will try to answer conceptual questions, for that please use the [issues](https://github.com/vertesy/X-Reactivation/issues) tab, rather than sending private emails.

Thank you for reading.
